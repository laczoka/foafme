Testing page content

1. Create an expected result either by hand, or issuing

./test.php store URL

where URL is the URL of the page you want to test

2. Run multiple tests by issuing

./test.php profiling [test_count] [path_to_client_certificate] [path_to_client_private_key]

All parameters are optional.

The certificate and private key are only interesting if the Foaf+SSL native login is being tested.

They should be in a PEM format.

The provide sample certificate and private key belong the the http://foaf.me/sample#me webid.
If this Foaf file is no longer available, please create a new one and export the certificate and the private key, so that you are able to pass them into the test script
